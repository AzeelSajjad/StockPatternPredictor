# StockPatternPredictor
This project allows for users to input stock data using the yfinance API and enables a stock chart analysis to predict the stock pattern of that chart.

It will predict one of the six patterns such as Bullish Flag, Bearish Wedge, Double Top, Double Bottom, Triple Top, and Triple Bottom.

The project uses image preproceessing to train a CNN model which allows for the prediction of the stock pattern to be determined.
